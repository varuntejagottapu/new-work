## C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)

Welcome to the C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension provides the following features inside VS Code:

* Lightweight development tools for [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io).
* Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
* Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono debugging is not supported. Desktop CLR debugging has [limited support](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/wiki/Desktop-.NET-Framework).
* Support for project.json and csproj projects on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The C# extension is powered by [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-roslyn).

### Get Started Writing C# in VS Code

## Note about using .NET Core 3.1.40x SDKs

The .NET 3.1.40x SDKs require version 16.7 of MSBuild.

For MacOS and Linux users who have Mono installed, this means you will need to set `omnisharp.useGlobalMono` to `never` until a version of Mono ships with MSBuild 16.7.

## Note about using .NET 5 SDKs

The .NET 5 SDK requires version 16.8 of MSBuild.

For Windows users who have Visual Studio installed, this means you will need to be on the latest Visual Studio 16.8 Preview.
For MacOS and Linux users who have Mono installed, this means you will need to set `omnisharp.useGlobalMono` to `never` until a version of Mono ships with MSBuild 16.8.

### Emmet support in Razor files

To enable emmet support, add the following to your settings.json:

```json
"emmet.includeLanguages": {
    "aspnetcorerazor": "html"
}
```

### Semantic Highlighting

The C# semantic highlighting support is in preview. To enable, set `editor.semanticHighlighting.enabled` and `csharp.semanticHighlighting.enabled` to `true` in your settings. Semantic highlighting is only provided for code files that are part of the active project.

To really see the difference, try the new Visual Studio 2019 Light and Dark themes with semantic colors that closely match Visual Studio 2019.

### Supported Operating Systems for Debugging

Currently, the C# debugger officially supports the following operating systems:

* X64 operating systems:
    * Windows 7 SP1 and newer
    * macOS 10.12 (Sierra) and newer
    * Linux: see [.NET Core documentation](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.2/2.2-supported-os.md#linux) for the list of supported distributions. Note that other Linux distributions will likely work as well as long as they include glibc and OpenSSL.
* ARM operating systems:
    * Linux is supported as a remote debugging target
